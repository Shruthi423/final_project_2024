          <h2>Remember Bing Bong?</h2>
          <p>
            Riley’s goofy, lovable imaginary friend? from Inside Out.
            <br />
            When he fades away in the Memory Dump after saying,
            <strong>“Take her to the moon for me!!”</strong>, I was done. I
            bawled like I’d lost my own childhood friend.
            <br />
            It got so bad that I had to pause the movie to process. But how
            could I? Bing Bong represented everything magical about being a kid!
            <br />
            Honestly, moments like that are why I love animated movies so much.
            They capture emotions that are so real, they make you laugh, cry,
            and hug your childhood memories a little tighter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Animated movies have always held a special place in my heart.
            Growing up, they weren’t just stories—they were magical adventures
            that shaped my imagination and taught me lessons in the most
            heartfelt ways. This project is deeply personal. It’s my way of
            celebrating the animated movies that inspired me, made me laugh, and
            sometimes even moved me to tears. They’ve been my companions during
            tough times, my spark of creativity, and my constant reminder that
            stories have the power to transform.
